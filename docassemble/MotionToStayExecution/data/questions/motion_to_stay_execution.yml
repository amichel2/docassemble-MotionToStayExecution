question: |
  Motion to Stay Execution
subquestion: |
  If you were unsuccessful with your eviction hearing or you agreed in a court judgement to move out, you can ask the court to delay your move-out from the property if you meet certain criteria within ten days of your hearing. A request for a Stay of Execution can be made only if it is a {no-fault eviction} if you are forced to leave without cause, and you cannot in good faith find a place to live. The amount of time you can ask for depends on the reason for the eviction.
  
  To use this form, you will need relevant Housing court documents including:
  
  *  The Summons and Complaint
  *  Your Housing Search Information (You will need this information for the {Housing Search Log}) 
  *  {48-Hour Notice} (if applicable)
  
terms:
  no-fault eviction: |
    Examples of no-fault eviction include:
    
    *   The landlord's family wants to move into your apartment.
    *   The landlord wants to sell the building    

  housing search log: |
    You will need to submit the Housing Search Log Form with you request for a Stay of Execution showing your search for apartments you tried to rent and things you have done to look for a new apartment.
 
  48-hour notice:  |
     If your landlord/owner won the eviction case, they will get an execution 10 days after the court enters the judgement. The landlord can use the execution to have a sheriff or constable physically remove you and your things from your home. The constable or sheriff must you give you **48 hours notice** before they can move you out.
